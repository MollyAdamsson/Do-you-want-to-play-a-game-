This is a website containing the well known game of Rock, paper or scissor, but with an interesting twist. This game is for the user who wants to play an easy game with an extra bit of fun.

These extra options were first introduced in an episode of The Big Bang Theory where Sheldon explains the rules: "Scissors decapitate Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors."
